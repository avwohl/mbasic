read the whole question. discuss dont change anything.  there are two questions
to answer at the end.
utils/checker/check_docs_consistency3.py makes a report of inconsistancies
the current one being docs/history/docs_inconsistencies_report-v22.md
The problem is when I ask you address them so the next report will get smaller
and smaller it does not happen.  For issues with multiple parts you make changes
but they never align.  You have tried having me word the requests to solve the issues
differently.  Here is the wording for processing v21 problems ```
use 5 agents like usual to fix docs/history/docs_inconsistencies_report-v21.md
Fix means:
  - Update ALL comments/docs/code involved in each inconsistency to be consistent
  - If two comments conflict, fix BOTH to agree
  - If comment contradicts code, fix whichever is wrong
  - Don't mark as ignored unless the checker is genuinely wrong (false positive)
  - For each fix, check for related mentions elsewhere and update those too
  Show counts when done. ```
But reading thru v22 I see problems that have been present for many versions, for example
these two :
1) handling of ERL in renum
2) **Description:** Contradictory information about FileIO integration status and
 filesystem abstraction architecture
I asked you to write utils/checker/check_docs_consistency3.py to have insconsistancies
worked out of the code and docs.  But after 22 runs it is a failure as it does not
converge on code and doc wording that removes most problems from the next runs report.
The questions for you:
1) if we look at this system as a failure to learn from, if you back
to the start of crossrefrencing code and docs and fixing conflicts or bugs convergant
way, is there anything that could actually work?
2) Did anyone else work on this problem
and come up with a working solution
