# Compiled BASIC-80

Documentation for the MBASIC compiler and code generation.

## Overview

The MBASIC compiler translates BASIC-80 programs into optimized machine code, providing significant performance improvements over interpreted execution.

## Topics

### [Optimizations](optimizations.md)
Learn about the 27 optimization techniques used by the compiler to improve performance and reduce code size.

### Code Generation
**Status:** In Progress

Documentation for the code generation phase will be added as the compiler backend is developed.
